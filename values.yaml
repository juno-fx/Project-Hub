namespace: argocd                         # namespace to deploy the Cluster-Builder to. Needs to be the same as where Argo is

projects:
#  - code:                                # name, this is what it will be called in ArgoCD
#    active:                              # active, specifies it the project should be deployed or "put to sleep"
#    private:                             # private, allows for NetworkPolicies to be created to isolate the project
                                          #   from external traffic. Essentially disabling the internet and all possible
                                          #   project cross talk.
